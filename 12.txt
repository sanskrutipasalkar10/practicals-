Java Code Implementation
1. Create the Car Interface
java
Copy code
// Car.java
public interface Car {
    void assemble();
}
2. Create the Concrete BasicCar Class
This is the basic car implementation that assembles a standard car.

java
Copy code
// BasicCar.java
public class BasicCar implements Car {

    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Basic Car assembled.");
    }
}
3. Create the CarDecorator Class
This is an abstract decorator class that implements the Car interface and contains a reference to a Car object. All decorators will extend this class to add their functionality.

java
Copy code
// CarDecorator.java
public abstract class CarDecorator implements Car {
    protected Car decoratedCar;

    public CarDecorator(Car car) {
        this.decoratedCar = car;
    }

    public void assemble() {
        this.decoratedCar.assemble();
    }
}
4. Create the SportsCarDecorator Class
This decorator adds sports car features to the basic car.

java
Copy code
// SportsCarDecorator.java
public class SportsCarDecorator extends CarDecorator {

    public SportsCarDecorator(Car car) {
        super(car);
    }

    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        super.assemble(); // Call the base assemble() method
        System.out.println("Adding features of Sports Car.");
        addSportsFeatures();
    }

    private void addSportsFeatures() {
        System.out.println("Adding Sports features: Spoilers, Sporty design.");
    }
}
5. Create the LuxuryCarDecorator Class
This decorator adds luxury car features to the basic car.

java
Copy code
// LuxuryCarDecorator.java
public class LuxuryCarDecorator extends CarDecorator {

    public LuxuryCarDecorator(Car car) {
        super(car);
    }

    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        super.assemble(); // Call the base assemble() method
        System.out.println("Adding features of Luxury Car.");
        addLuxuryFeatures();
    }

    private void addLuxuryFeatures() {
        System.out.println("Adding Luxury features: Leather seats, Premium sound system.");
    }
}
6. Create the Client Code to Test the Decorators
Now we will test the decorators with a BasicCar and apply the SportsCarDecorator and LuxuryCarDecorator.

java
Copy code
// DecoratorPatternTest.java
public class DecoratorPatternTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a basic car
        Car sportsCar = new SportsCarDecorator(new BasicCar());
        sportsCar.assemble(); // Assemble the basic car with sports car features

        System.out.println("\n*****");

        // Create a luxury car
        Car sportsLuxuryCar = new LuxuryCarDecorator(new SportsCarDecorator(new BasicCar()));
        sportsLuxuryCar.assemble(); // Assemble the basic car with both sports and luxury features
    }
}
Output:
yaml
Copy code
Basic Car assembled.
Adding features of Sports Car.
Adding Sports features: Spoilers, Sporty design.

*****

Basic Car assembled.
Adding features of Sports Car.
Adding Sports features: Spoilers, Sporty design.
Adding features of Luxury Car.
Adding Luxury features: Leather seats, Premium sound system.
Explanation of the Code:
Car Interface: Defines the assemble() method, which is implemented by all concrete classes.
BasicCar: Implements the Car interface and provides the basic functionality for assembling a car.
CarDecorator: An abstract class that implements the Car interface and has a reference to the Car object. This class allows us to add new functionality to the assemble() method dynamically.
SportsCarDecorator: Adds specific features related to sports cars, such as spoilers and sporty design, by calling the assemble() method of the wrapped Car object.
LuxuryCarDecorator: Adds luxury features such as leather seats and a premium sound system.
DecoratorPatternTest: Demonstrates how decorators can be combined. The SportsCarDecorator and LuxuryCarDecorator can be applied in sequence to a BasicCar, allowing us to create a car with sports and luxury features dynamically.
Why This is the Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator Pattern allows us to dynamically add new features to an object without altering its structure. In this case, we can add features to a Car object at runtime using the SportsCarDecorator and LuxuryCarDecorator.
The decorators (i.e., SportsCarDecorator and LuxuryCarDecorator) "decorate" the basic car with additional functionality, without modifying the original Car implementation (BasicCar).
This is a classic implementation of the Decorator Pattern, where the behavior of the object is enhanced in a flexible and reusable way.

Here's a basic MicroPython code to scan for available Wi-Fi networks:

Python
import network

def scan_networks():
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    nets = wlan.scan()

    for net in nets:
        ssid = net[0].decode('utf-8')
        bssid = net[1]
        channel = net[2]
        rssi = net[3] - 100
        authmode = net[4]
        hidden = net[5]

        print(f"SSID: {ssid}\nBSSID: {bssid}\nChannel: {channel}\nRSSI: {rssi}\nAuthmode: {authmode}\nHidden: {hidden}\n")

scan_networks()
Use code with caution.

How to Use This Code on Tinkercad:

Create a New Circuit: Start a new circuit on Tinkercad.
Add an ESP32 Board: Drag and drop an ESP32 board onto the workspace.
Write the Code: Use the built-in code editor to input the Python code above.
Simulate: Click the "Start Simulation" button to run the code.
Connection Details:

Power: Connect the ESP32 to the 5V power supply on the Tinkercad breadboard.
Ground: Connect the ground pin of the ESP32 to the ground rail on the breadboard.
Additional Considerations:

Security: Be cautious when scanning networks, especially in public spaces. Respect network privacy and avoid unauthorized access.
Network Strength: RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) provides information about the strength of the Wi-Fi signal. A higher RSSI value indicates a stronger signal.
Authentication: The authmode field indicates the authentication method used by the network (e.g., WPA2-PSK, WPA3-SAE).
By combining the power of MicroPython and Tinkercad, you can effectively explore network scanning and other IoT concepts.
